  Sarah's Sitting Service 
 </h1>
      <p>
        I chose to become a baby sitter because I have always wanted  little siblings but my parents <em>did not</em> agree with that  so I got into baby sitting. 
         My mom has always told me that I have a way with kids and don't doubt that just because I'm only twelve.
          <strong>No matter</strong> what age your child(ren) is I can watch them.
           <strong>Relax!</strong>
            Go on a date night!
            <strong> Go have fun!</strong> 
            You don't need to worry about anybody but <u>yourself!</u>
